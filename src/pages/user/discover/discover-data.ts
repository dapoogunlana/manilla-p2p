            `“Every Tom and Harry runs to them now. ‘To heck with those centralized systems eating our efforts on the internet; selling our data to those manipulative government-owned and private bodies!’ – blockchain fanatics rant. Now, aren’t the whales among them trying to show their prowess and play along the exact thing their method fights against!? Decentralized my foot!”`,
            `The fact that this next-generation technology is still in its infancy means that over 50% of its users still require the advice of the whales. Yet, debunking the famous blogs and tweets’ footer section that usually reads “this is not a financial advice” in the process. While a lot of the gurus see this as an avenue to grow their followings, a few often forget that this tech needs no “king”. It is not dying, so why would it require an intervention of a “saviour”?!`,
            `Now the market bleeds seriously. Panick sellers are seen doing what they do the best – flood the market with more “sell orders” than the opposite, and hence initializing a market crash. The math needs no long explanation. As at the press time, Bitcoin is fighting the $38,000 resistance. We all know what happens once that is broken. That resistance isn’t as strong as the $40k+s. And the supposed tech guru is being beaten with his very own cane as he continues to contradict himself. Oh Elon!`,
            `Where is Doge? Struggling with BTC and its brothers in the altcoins sphere. The scuffles we encountered in the market this week is all thanks to the Tesla owner. While I personally think that this amazing project (Tesla) will save humanity ways more than we have figured so far, sometimes you cannot help but feel that the man does not know as much as he thinks he does in regard to cryptocurrency. You cannot have your bread and still have it.`,
            `The greens are showing back. It is always good to see the greens. Whether you are an investor in sport bets, a gambler, an FX trader or one that shares the same vision as us – a cryptocurrency trader. The panic sellers, unsurprisingly might not recover their loss, but at least, they learnt from the happenings, hopefully. And the experienced traders? Hold my beer please!`,
            `While updates; tweets and real time blogs from the cryptocurrency whales and gurus can benefit us in getting a hint on where the prices are heading to; up or down the trend, one needs to follow his head more than his mind. I am not against Elon. Neither am I backing his competitors, the Bitcoin loyalists. But it is my belief that cryptocurrency never needs a king. And you better believe.`
